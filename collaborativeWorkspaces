<h3>Explanation</h3>
  <p>In our team which is known as Soupafoods, where our group members can all collaborate and contribute through several applications that 
  enable sharing such as Google Drive where we are able to share our documents together which can be viewed and edited if needed. Our 
  main source of communication is through Microsoft Teams where we are able to have our meetings with the addition of being able to send 
  and receive messages to the team. We are also able to link our Trello board in Teams so we are able to identify what tasks need to be 
  completed or what will be done in the near future. Lastly, we are able to combine our documents together which is turned into HTML code 
  through GitHub, where we are able to share our code together which is then combined to create the completed assignment work. </p>
  <p>All of our group members communicate on Microsoft Teams where we are able to tell one another, such as a summary of a meeting that was 
  missed, where we are all able to access the applications (Teams, Drive, GitHub and Trello) and contribute their share of work.</p>
