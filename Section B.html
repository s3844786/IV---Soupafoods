    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Superafoods is an application that will make your grocery shopping experience more efficient and hassle-free. This application will also help to reduce problems like food wastage and over-buying with the addition of helping you save money. The application is used so that the user can be more efficient with their limited time. Additionally, the additional features that are included into the application will help the user to identify what needs to be bought from the shops, what products are on special as well as offering a recipe section of what food they can make with the ingredients that they have on hand. Some examples of these features include: the ability to monitor the number of items in the household, expiry date tracker, recommended recipe section along with some additional features.</p>
    <p>Some functions that will be implemented into our grocery application are a grocery list, expiry date tracker, suggested recipes (based on the ingredients that the customer has) and catalogue section where the specials can be located or even be compared to other grocery stores. There are many features that we would like to implement into our application, however, we would like to make it as unique as possible with the maximum amount of features that will help assist the customer while not overwhelming the customers with too many features.</p>
    <p>As a grocery application, it is necessary for the customer to be able to have a list of items they would need to buy as it will come in handy if they forget what item they need to buy. Additionally, it would be helpful for the customer to identify how many of these items they have on hand or what they have at home, which will be convenient for the users decision making whether they would like to purchase the product or not. It will be convenient for the user to check out their “pantry section” which will notify the products expiry date if they will go bad where the application provides a recipe feature of recipes that the user can make with the ingredient in their pantry. To maximise the customers time, a catalogue section is provided where they can access the weekly catalogue of each supermarket. To maximise the use of the application with others in the family, the application can sync with other devices that are connected to the same group so they will not be any more double ups of items bought!</p>
    <p>In a scenario where the user would use this app, we would need to put ourselves in the shoes of a user that is using this application. For example, as a shopper, I want to have a list of items, so I can know whether I would like to buy the item or not. As a shopper, I want to see what is special at different supermarkets, so I can purchase the products I would like to buy. As a parent, I want to store receipts, so I can see how many items I have bought and how much I have spent for easier time to track my spending on groceries. As a parent, I want to be able to track the expiry date of the products, so I can make use of the items instead of wasting the product. As a university student, I want to store items, so I can see how many items I have at home so I can decide whether I should buy more or not. As a university student, I want to see any suggested recipes with the ingredients I have, so I can use up some ingredients and try new foods which may taste good while being on a budget.</p>
