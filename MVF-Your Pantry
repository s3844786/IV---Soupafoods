<h2>Your Pantry</h2>

<p>
In this interface, the system lists almost all the foods that can be bought in the market (categorized according to the type of food). The user can use it as a "shopping cart", plan the food to be purchased in advance, and add it to this page. And use this as a checklist to purchase online or go to the supermarket in person. Of course, it is not just as simple as adding the food that needs to be purchased, users can clearly see the price corresponding to each food, and when choosing different specifications, the price will also change. The user can also enter the number of people in the family, and the system will automatically help the user to match according to the specific number of meals, the nutritional value table and the number of days the food is maintained. Compared with the traditional "healthy diet" software, it has a huge innovation.

<p>
In addition, we will upload all the ingredients added by the user in the past year (by date index) to the Cloud, and check the market price and food one-to-one correspondence. And the system will draw a table to record changes over time. The advantage of this is that users can check which ingredients they have purchased in the past at any time, and can even meet the needs of the kitchen account book.

<h3>Scenario</h3>

<p>
Jerry is a 38-year-old single employee. Due to work needs, he goes to work very early almost every day and comes home very late at night. He rarely has time to eat at home. Nevertheless, he still likes to cook at home, and whenever he is free, he will go to the supermarket to buy a lot of foods. However, he often bought a lot of food. Due to the uncertainty of work, he could not go home on time for a period of time. He could only eat in the company cafeteria or order takeaway every day, which led to the deterioration of many foods he just bought. This makes him very distressed. He hopes to remind him in any way......

<p>
When he used our software and clicked on the interface of Your pantry, he felt that he could make a list here. He carefully browsed different kinds of food, such as vegetables, fruits, meat, etc. He wanted to buy various kinds of food  and research different styles of dishes. But when he enters the family population and dining time (only one person, estimated 2-3 days), the system pops up a "warning bar" to tell Jerry that the selected food has seriously exceeded the standard, and the number of people that does not meet the set is within the specified time. May cause a lot of waste. This directly reminds Jerry to consider the particularity of his job and whether he can use these foods reasonably during his time at home. In addition, he also discovered that the interface has an option to automatically assign it. When he clicks on this option, the system automatically selects the right food for him, and the nutrition is balanced. Each time he clicks, there will be different kinds of food combinations. Jerry can also judge the frequency of shopping and the foods that need to be purchased frequently based on the time of the previous shopping list. Jerry believes that the software has helped him solve many problems related to kitchen ingredients and greatly improved his quality of life. He is very satisfied.
