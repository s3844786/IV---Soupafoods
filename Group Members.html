    <p>I am a first year student in Bachelor of IT. I&#39;m somewhat interested in IT and have found it to be the most enjoyable course that I&#39;ve been studying. I hope to be able to develop websites as a starting point and then dive further into developing more technical software and programs.</p>
    <p>Communication is something that I find myself good at when it comes to group work. Currently, I don&#39;t have many strong points in the field of IT yet. Something that interests me is how technology continues to advance at a constant rate and hopefully someday I would like to be a part of that change.</p>
    <p>My current weak points would definitely be the use of coding language to write code and develop webpages, programs etc. As an outcome of this project, I hope to learn more and develop a deeper understanding about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to create web pages and programs. In terms of this project, I believe that I will have a bit of trouble with understanding GitHub as there is a lot of HTML and will probably ask for help from my team members.</p>
    <p>I see myself contributing to the team in the area of creating ideas and such for the application which we have chosen. In terms of technical IT skills, I am not the best however I can see myself being able to provide ideas in discussions.</p>

    <p>I am a first year student in Bachelor of IT. I have always had an interest in the IT field which began to grow during my high school years, where I have taken multiple courses in IT. As it begins to become more integrated into the lives of the general public, I want to be at the head of that change in order to help make the life of the average person easier.</p>
    <p>I find my strength in IT mainly focuses around the field of programming, writing code and HTML as it&#39;s the area of the project I can see myself most focused on doing and would like to do the most. My weak areas would be communication and time management as I tend to leave work until late to complete it which would be unfair on the team so I will need to communicate with them and make sure I am completing work on time and to a standard the team can be happy with. With this project I would like to become a better teammate who is able to communicate with their team in a consistent manner and not just when asked a question.</p>
    <p>A challenge I think I will face will include the actual design of the project as I am not the best at designing a simple project as I tend to want to continue to add extra features until it becomes too bloated and complex and the vision strays from what the project was originally intended to be. In this project, I see myself doing mostly coding tasks but I am willing to do any task the team needs from me.</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Sri Lanka and I came to Melbourne at the start of 2020. I had an interest in computers ever since I was old enough to operate one. It still baffles me how such a small compact device can do so much. This interest led me to study and learn about Information Technology. During my school years, I undertook and studied multiple IT courses as well. I have always been one to think about new inventions and systems that can make our lives easier and more efficient and I realised that this can be done through studying IT. That is my passion in IT.</p>
    <p>I would like to say I am proficient in looking at projects such as this from a third person view, which allows the final product to be exactly what it is expected to be.I also enjoy taking on a challenge and trying new things which I believe is necessary for growth. In terms of ability, I like to code HTML even though I am not the best at it. Something I am not so good at is time management but I hope to fix this issue in this assignment as my slacking off can severely affect another person. I would also like to become a much better programmer.</p>
    <p>I believe that one challenge for me would be making sure the whole group is on the same page on all the decisions. However, this has not been a problem yet. Another challenge I see is getting all the work done in time. I would like to work on tasks that are focused on design and coding.</p>

    <p>Hello, this is a picture of me above. I was born in Australia whereas both my parents come from China. I can understand and speak both Chinese and English.</p>
    <p>I have little knowledge in the IT field however I do hope to learn and understand more about the IT industry. I also hope that I am able to understand IT in finer detail as it is always evolving and taking it to the next level. My strong point is that if I need to complete something, I would try to complete it as soon as possible to the best of my ability. If I ever have extra time, I would be willing to assist my group members if they would need assistance to complete some tasks. In this period of time writing this, I currently have interests in UX and UI design as I find that area of IT interesting and amusing. I believe that that will have weak points such as a beginner at programming, or some other skills that I may have not have known that I am not strong in that area.</p>
    <p>Some challenges that we may face with our project is to add as many features as possible without overwhelming or interfering with the users experience and usability. I believe that I can research much further into this project, what will make our project unique compared to others and help design the application for the prototype.</p>

    <p>I come from Hefei, a small city in central China. My hobby is to browse review videos and reports on various mobile phones and computers. Whenever a new product is released, I am very excited to compare their screens, processors, and various parameters. It is precisely because of this that I chose this course, or that I chose this major. I hope that the university courses can help me further understand the internal structure and software algorithms of these electronic products, and take it as my future Development goals, become a professional commentator, or join these technology companies.</p>
    <p>I have only learned the introductory knowledge about Java and some simple UI design. My interest may be more biased towards programming languages. I think the UI of a product is very important, but its core idea, what it can do/bring for users, is the most important. I think that in my next college career, I can learn more programming courses and get some practical opportunities, which will provide me a lot of help in teamwork and personal projects.</p>

    <p>I am currently studying in China due to the COVID-19. It&#39;s my second semester as an IT student. My passion in IT started in high school when my teacher introduced me to a programming language called Visual Basic. In the last semester, I have learned a new programming language--Java, which now I believe has become my strong point.</p>
    <p>My biggest weak point is communication, luckily in this course I now have many opportunities to communicate with my group and hopefully improve my communication skills. For the project, I am worried about user experiences. However, I believe that I can use the knowledge I learned from UCD class to help my team to overcome this challenge.</p>
