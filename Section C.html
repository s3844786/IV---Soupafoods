    <h1>Demonstrable Outcomes</h1>
    <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
    <p>Some of the factors that we were looking for when deciding on a project is whether the product is practical and if it can be completed with current technology. The idea of an application that will allow you to manage your groceries from your phone appeared to fulfill both of these requirements. Therefore we chose this project. Furthermore, we figured that this application can assist in solving day to day issues such as food wastage, money mismanagement and will help you to be more efficient when you go out to buy groceries.</p>
    <p>We discovered that this app could actually help us in our own lives as most of the group do their own grocery shopping and have resonated that they do have the problems that this application sets out to fix.This fact greatly motivated us to choose this project because we realised this application does have a lot of practical benefits.</p>
    <p>The idea for this project seemed as if it could be done with our individual skills that we currently possess. It didn't seem too far fetched or technologically impossible. That being said, most of us are not exactly experienced  so this app will give us the opportunity to go beyond what we know and can do. In terms of enriching our IT skills, this project gives opportunity for all types of IT skills ranging from coding to designing as both the back-end and front-end development of this app is extremely important.</p>
    <p>The idea behind this project was born in Introduction to IT. The original application started off as a gadget that scans expiration dates which then deposits the date and the item name into a repository of items that was on a mobile app. After further thought and helpful feedback from the tutor, the group decided to change the whole idea from a connected gadget and app to a more fleshed out and feature packed standalone mobile application. This was done mainly because that it was understood based on the feedback we got that developing this app to work with another gadget seemed too complicated especially at that level. Therefore with the tutor’s feedback in mind, the project idea was reformed.  This version of that project is more in line with the idea we decided on for our project. This included many of the features that were going to be added to the original project.</p>

    <h2>Minimal Viable Features (MVF)</h2>
    <h3>Recipes</h3>
    <p>We have built-in thousands of nutritional recipes, which are classified strictly according to many factors such as food types, calories, styles of different countries, and cooking time, so that users can directly select the recipe they need to cook according to the index mark. After choosing any recipe, it clearly displays the required ingredients, seasonings, nutritional value table, cooking time and feedback and evaluation of users who have tried the recipe. When the food that the user wants to cook happens to be that we don't have this recipe, the program will directly launch the system browser and help the user search on the Internet. We also help some special people (such as: Vegan, Gluten free, Lactose free). When users submit ingredients that they are allergic to or cannot eat for some reason, the recipes containing these ingredients are automatically filtered to prevent users from eating them without their knowledge. The user can also first select the food style of a certain country and enter the number of people to eat. The system will automatically allocate recipes with high praise rates to users.</p>
    <h3>Promotion Catalogue</h3>
    <p>With the user's consent, we will locate the user's location, search for nearby large supermarkets, and push weekly discounts to the user. Categorize discount strength, product types, and shelf life time to give users a better experience. We will also actively cooperate with some large international supermarkets or local small supermarkets to promote their discount products and attract popularity. At the same time, these supermarkets are also required to provide additional discount coupons to be distributed to users through our software to achieve a win-win effect.</p>
    <h3>Shopping list and Your Pantry connectivity</h3>
    <p>First of all, the time for each family to purchase food is not fixed. Some families need to buy food every day, while others only buy it once a week. We need users to input the average time they go out to buy food products, and make a nutritional match for the food purchased during that time. The program will display the energy, vitamins, carbohydrates and other nutritional factors that need to be taken in each day, based on the number of people in the family, in the form of a list. In addition, the food pairing are given for users to refer to and screen. When users buy condiments or daily necessities (milk, bread, rice, etc.), they can make notes in the software. The software will calculate the daily consumption and inform the user in advance that the daily necessities at home are insufficient and need to be re- buy.</p>
    <h3>Shopping List</h3>
    <p>In this feature, users can create a shopping list by themselves. The list contains some items we have already provided, but users can add new items according to their own needs. Users can mark favorite items so they can easily find and add these items to their shopping list. Not only that, users can also share their shopping list with their family or friends.In addition, users only need to click on the calendar so they can add a shopping list on any day. When this day is almost there, users will receive a reminder that contains the information about  what they need to buy.</p>
    <h3>Your Pantry</h3>
    <p>This feature can display the items that the user has added, the unit price and quantity will be provided behind each item, and the total price will be displayed at the end of the list. This feature can also help users view the purchase history of the last week, month, and year. Of course, users can also choose to hide or delete the purchase history. This feature can also draw a bar graph to show the change of consumption over time.</p>
    <h3>Expiration date tracker</h3>
    <p>The user initially needs to scan the barcode of the item, and then the detailed information of the item will appear,then users can choose to save the information. When the item is about to expire, the user will receive a message.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Extended Viable Features (EVP)</h2>
    <h3>‘Money saved’ tracking as well as other statistics and achievements</h3>
    <p>This feature will provide users a sense of achievement once they have successfully used the app. The purpose of this app is to help users save money on groceries, prevent, or reduce food wastage and to stay organised. When users see the statistics such as the amount of money they have saved or the amount of time they have saved by using the app, they will feel like they have accomplished something significant. This relates to every type of user ranging from university students to the elderly.</p>
    <h3>Synchronized shared experience (eg:- within a family)</h3>
    <p>In terms of use, this feature will probably be used within families. It helps to keep users connected with one another to keep track of what is in the pantry. This allows each member of the family to find out in real-time, what is purchased by each family member and the current inventory of the pantry. This feature will be added as an extended feature as it isn’t really a necessity however would be a nice implementation and useful for parents alongside students.</p>
    <h3>A Calendar feature – to help with meal preparation, see what day you went to buy groceries etc.</h3>
    <p>This feature will be useful in things organised and timely which is a great way to stay efficient and save time. Staying organised is important to many of the targeted user profiles as it is a must for parents and students who are very limited on time. By implementing a calendar, it will give users easy access to see when a ‘favourite’ food is about to expire, when you last went to the shops, what days you have planned a meal for (meal prepping) etc. We have decided to add this as an extended feature in order to appeal to parents and students who wish to stay organised and thus stay efficient with their time.</p>
