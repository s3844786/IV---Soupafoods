<h2> Project Justifications</h2>

<h2> Beyond Current Capabilities</h2>
<p>Andy: My current level of IT knowledge is somewhere between beginner level and intermediate. I’ve learnt a bit about Python and Java however, not been able to fully understand and grasp the concepts. I am currently taking the Web Programming subject and slowly learning HTML and CSS so hopefully, I will be able to implement these new skills and help assist the team in hosting the webpage and prototyping the application. As stated in my team profile section, I will most likely be lacking in the area of coding so I hope to use this chance to learn more about HTML and CSS as well as how to properly utilise AWS.</p>

<h3> Team-dynamic challenge</h3>
<p>Due to the current and unfortunate events of the pandemic, our team hasn’t been able to come together for face-to-face meetings. We also face the challenge of a time-zone difference with members of our team. This has made it difficult to organise times for meetings where we should be discussing and advancing our work on the assignment. </p>

<p>However, we have an alternative way of doing meetings which are online meetings via Microsoft Teams. For those who cannot attend these meetings, we can use Microsoft Teams as a virtual bulletin board and post up meeting summaries and assign tasks which need to be completed by a set date. In terms of collaborative work, we use the service Google Drive in order to allow us to work as a collective online. It allows us to share documents with each other whilst giving us access to real-time changes to documents whilst allowing us to all work on the same document. These are the few steps we have taken to try and overcome  the challenges we are facing.</p>
