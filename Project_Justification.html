<h2> Project Justifications</h2>

<h2> Beyond Current Capabilities</h2>
<p>I would say that my current IT capabilities are at intermediate level for writing code as I have a good understanding of both Java and C# as well as a beginning level of knowledge for python. My knowledge of css and html are not great but I am taking a web programming class so I hope that I will be able to become more comfortable with these languages. I also hope to become more comfortable with Github and AWS as last semester I struggled with using these services.</p>

<h3> Team-dynamic challenge</h3>
<p>As a team we face the challenge of having members spread out over multiple time zones, we also face the issue that the members of the team have differing class time tables and other obligations such as jobs. These issues have resulted in difficulties in scheduling a time that is suitable for all the members of the team. In order to counteract this challenge we have begun to schedule meetings on weekends when the entire team is free. While also recording any meetings we have during the week so that if a member is unable to attend a particular meeting they are able to view the meeting later when they are free to do so. We also put tasks that are expected to be completed on the trello board to remind each other of tasks that need to be completed.
