<p>I come from Hefei, a small city in central China. My hobby is to browse review videos and reports on various mobile phones and computers. Whenever a new product is released, I am very excited to compare their screens, processors, and various parameters. It is precisely because of this that I chose this course, or that I chose this major. I hope that the university courses can help me further understand the internal structure and software algorithms of these electronic products, and take it as my future Development goals, become a professional commentator, or join these technology companies. I have only learned the introductory knowledge about Java and some simple UI design. My interest may be more biased towards programming languages. I think the UI of a product is very important, but its core idea, what it can do/bring for users, is the most important. I think that in my next college career, I can learn more programming courses and get some practical opportunities, which will provide me a lot of help in teamwork and personal projects.</p>

<h2>Minimal Viable Features:</h2>
<p>Recipes:

We have built-in thousands of nutritional recipes, which are classified strictly according to many factors such as food types, calories, styles of different countries, and cooking time, so that users can directly select the recipe they need to cook according to the index mark. After choosing any recipe, it clearly displays the required ingredients, seasonings, nutritional value table, cooking time and feedback and evaluation of users who have tried the recipe. When the food that the user wants to cook happens to be that we don't have this recipe, the program will directly launch the system browser and help the user search on the Internet. We also help some special people (such as: Vegan, Gluten free, Lactose free). When users submit ingredients that they are allergic to or cannot eat for some reason, the recipes containing these ingredients are automatically filtered to prevent users from eating them without their knowledge. The user can also first select the food style of a certain country and enter the number of people to eat. The system will automatically allocate recipes with high praise rates to users.
 </p>
 
 <p>Promo Catalog:

With the user's consent, we will locate the user's location, search for nearby large supermarkets, and push weekly discounts to the user. Categorize discount strength, product types, and shelf life time to give users a better experience. We will also actively cooperate with some large international supermarkets or local small supermarkets to promote their discount products and attract popularity. At the same time, these supermarkets are also required to provide additional discount coupons to be distributed to users through our software to achieve a win-win effect.
</p>

<p>Shopping list and your Pantry connectivity:
  
First of all, the time for each family to purchase food is not fixed. Some families need to buy food every day, while others only buy it once a week. We need users to input the average time they go out to buy food products, and make a nutritional match for the food purchased during that time. The program will display the energy, vitamins, carbohydrates and other nutritional factors that need to be taken in each day, based on the number of people in the family, in the form of a list. In addition, the food pairing are given for users to refer to and screen. When users buy condiments or daily necessities (milk, bread, rice, etc.), they can make notes in the software. The software will calculate the daily consumption and inform the user in advance that the daily necessities at home are insufficient and need to be re- buy.

<h2>Beyond current capabilities:</h2>

<p>
For now, this is my first year in university, and the knowledge I have can not complete the entire project. Therefore, I need some like-minded friends to form a team to face these difficulties together. I have studied the UI design of some applications before. I clearly know what kind of UI design can attract users, and it is simple and clear, so that users can quickly find the interface or function they need by browsing the interface information. In terms of software security, each user needs to have an independent account, otherwise their information can be easily stolen. I have learned some encryption algorithms, such as: RSA encryption, I think this will provide great help to the project. I may not have contacted some of the remaining content. I need to learn more professional knowledge and consult my teammates to make myself grow.
</p>

<h2>Project Risks:</h2>

<p>
In addition, there are differences in opinions among team members that are likely to cause project failure. Regarding a project, every detail requires a lot of discussion among members to arrive at a final plan and plan to implement it. But in the process of discussion, it is inevitable that there will be different opinions among members. Everyone thinks that their ideas are correct and want to persuade others to agree with their opinions. This kind of craftsmanship in order to develop good products is desirable, but to a certain extent, it will seriously hinder the progress of the project. The project will not be executed for a long time due to disputes between some members. In order to reduce or reduce this risk, a good leader is essential. First of all, we must select a leader that everyone recognizes and is responsible. When similar situations arise, the leader needs to think calmly, consult the opinions of each team member, and select a method that best meets the interests of the project to implement. This can effectively reduce the risk.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<h3>
Google Drive
</h3>
<p>
As we all know, Google drive is one of the best clouds in the world. Due to irresistible reasons such as the new crown virus, we cannot communicate with members offline.</p>
<p>
Multi-person editing: During the project, we can write and edit manuscripts online at the same time, and give marks and some modification comments.</p>
<p>
Cloud storage: Google Drive has a lot more cloud storage space compared to similar cloud software, and classification management is also very user-friendly.</p>
<p>
Rich plug-ins: In the system interface and actual experience, it is found that google drive can edit common files online.</p>
<p>
Easy to share: Just enter the other party's Gmail, you can easily complete the sharing, you can also set permissions, edit/view only.</p>
<p>
Low cost of use: The free account has a cloud cost of 15GB, and the memory upgrade through the enterprise/school account is also very cheap.</p>
<p>
Substitute products：Visual Studio supports multiple languages. Beginners can choose VB.Net or C# to start with. Compared with the obscure old programming languages, VB.Net and C# under the .Net architecture have made great progress, especially C# is a concise and powerful language., Has made it the most complete and potential development language in the world. In addition, the .Net platform has another incomparable advantage: the .Net framework has the largest and most comprehensive class library in human history, which makes a lot of seemingly complex tasks easy.

<h2>Your Pantry</h2>

<p>
In this interface, the user can manually add the ingredients and condiments already in the kitchen, the specific quantity and quality, and calculate according to the daily consumption of the household population to estimate the time period of each food (including condiments) Will be consumed, and remind users three days in advance. Although most users cook in the kitchen every day, they can directly observe the consumption of ingredients and replenish them. This part of the users may feel that this function is more tasteless. But every ingredient has a different shelf life, such as milk, bread and other common foods. When the user has not consumed these foods when they are approaching the expiration date, the software will remind the user to replace them in time to avoid eating them after the expiration date.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we will upload all the ingredients added by the user in the past year (by date index) to the Cloud, and check the market price and food one-to-one correspondence. And the system will draw a table to record changes over time. The advantage of this is that users can check which ingredients they have purchased in the past at any time, and can even meet the needs of the kitchen account book.

<h3>Scenario</h3>

<p>
Jerry is a 38-year-old single employee. Due to work needs, he goes to work very early almost every day and comes home very late at night. He rarely has time to eat at home. Nevertheless, he still likes to cook at home, and whenever he is free, he will go to the supermarket to buy a lot of foods. But he often forgets how long the vegetables are left, and does not know whether the bread and milk in the refrigerator have gone bad. This makes him very distressed. He hopes to remind him in any way...... 
</p>

<p>
When he used our software and clicked on the interface of Your pantry, he clearly found that he only needs to add the name and quantity of the purchased ingredients to the program after shopping, and the system will automatically help him record the preservation time. 3-5 days before the ingredients expire, the software will send a push to Jerry's mobile phone to remind Jerry that some food in the kitchen and refrigerator will expire and cannot be used, and he needs to go to the supermarket again to buy fresh ingredients. Jerry can also judge his shopping frequency and what foods he often needs to buy based on the time and type of ingredients added before. Jerry believes that this software has helped him solve many problems about kitchen ingredients and greatly improved his quality of life. He is very satisfied.
