<p>I am currently studying in China due to the covid-19. It’s my second semester as a IT student. My passion in IT started in high school when my teacher introduced me to a programming language called Visual Basic.In the last semester I have learned a new programming language--Java, which now I believe has become my strong point. My biggest weak point is communication,luckily in this course I now have many opportunities to communicate with my group and hopefully it will improve my communication skills. For the project, I am worried about user experiences. However, I believe that I can use the knowledge I learned from UCD class to help  my team to overcome this challenge.</p>


<h2>Minimal Viable Features:</h2>
<p>Shopping List:

In this feature, users can create a shopping list by themselves. The list contains some items we have already provided, but users can add new items according to their own needs. Users can mark favorite items so they can easily find and add these items to their shopping list. Not only that, users can also share their shopping list with their family or friends.In addition, users only need to click on the calendar so they can add a shopping list on any day. When this day is almost there, users will receive a reminder that contains the information about  what they need to buy.
 </p>
 
<p> Your Pantry:

This feature can display the items that the user has added, the unit price and quantity will be provided behind each item, and the total price will be displayed at the end of the list. This feature can also help users view the purchase history of the last week, month, and year. Of course, users can also choose to hide or delete the purchase history. This feature can also draw a bar graph to show the change of consumption over time.
</p>
<p>Expiration date tracker:

The user initially needs to scan the barcode of the item, and then the detailed information of the item will appear,then users can choose to save the information. When the item is about to expire, the user will receive a message.</p>

<h2>Beyond current capabilities:</h2>
<p>
The knowledge I have now is not enough to support me to complete the entire project, so during this period,I also want to make up for my shortcomings with the help of team members. One of the previous semester’s assignment is to build the prototype of an application,which provide me some centern skills on completing the assignment .For example,  I have now understood some knowledge about UCD, designing an app's prototype and user interface.In addition, I have some understanding of writing HTML code as well as JAVA.However, when it comes to web page designing, I find it's really struggle for me to write CSS code so I need to spend more time to research about it and learn it by myself. As for this assignment, I need to learn some more complicated skills like how to track expiration dates of items by simply scanning their barcodes. And some database knowledge since we need to save users shopping history and synchronize each account to one another.
</p>

<h2>Project Risks:</h2>
<p>In this project,one of the greatest risks is technical challenges which may lead to an incomplete project. We have high expectations for this project so we added some features that are impossible  to achieve when we actually build the prototype. For example one of the features is to  help users to find the expiration date of items. And to achieve that users only need to scan the barcode of items. It may sound simple but to achieve this feature we need to acquire much more skillful and difficult knowledge about programming and databases. To tackle this risk, we need a lot of time to do the research and self-learning, and of course the frequency of group meetings needs to be increased,and if it's far beyond our ability we could try to show the feature as completely as possible.
