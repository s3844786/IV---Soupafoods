    <h1>Project Justification</h1>
    <h2>Beyond Current Capabilities</h2>
    <p>Within our group, most of our group members are beginners or have some knowledge in the IT field such as programming and web development. As some members have some knowledge of programming languages such as C#, Python, HTML and Java which can help assist in the group in any sort of way. With the assistance of the Bachelor of Information Technology course, we are taking the Web Programming course which can help further enhance our knowledge and understanding to create a good website. The positive side of having a large group of people is that if we have a skill that we are weak at such as HTML coding, another member has the ability to fulfill this weakness as their strength is in HTML coding. The knowledge we have from taking User Centered Design class in the IT course will help us to implement the ideas we have learnt into our grocery application that will improve the user experience. Additionally, some members in our groups have some knowledge in other IT skills such as some security , algorithms and coding skills.</p>
    <h2>Project Risks</h2>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p>A risk that may affect the project is that the tasks that need to be completed were not completed, which results in others to go back and spend time to complete the task which will delay the project completion. In order to monitor this risk, we would need to see how much each person has done at each meeting and see what tasks have been completed or not which will help track down what tasks can be ticked off and what tasks that need to be completed asap. To reduce this risk or avoid the risk, each member of the group should be spending their time on completing the tasks that are given to their capabilities as soon as possible to avoid not getting the task completed.</p>
    <p>In this project, one of the greatest risks is technical challenges which may lead to an incomplete project. We have high expectations for this project so we added some features that are impossible to achieve when we actually build the prototype. For example, one of the features is to help users to find the expiration date of items. And to achieve that users only need to scan the barcode of items. It may sound simple but to achieve this feature, we need to acquire much more skillful and difficult knowledge about programming and databases. To tackle this risk, we need a lot of time to do the research and self-learning, and of course the frequency of group meetings needs to be increased,and if it is far beyond our ability we could try to show the feature as completely as possible.</p>
    <p>In addition, there are differences in opinions among team members that are likely to cause project failure. Regarding a project, every detail requires a lot of discussion among members to arrive at a final plan and plan to implement it. But in the process of discussion, it is inevitable that there will be different opinions among members. Everyone thinks that their ideas are correct and want to persuade others to agree with their opinions. This kind of craftsmanship in order to develop good products is desirable, but to a certain extent, it will seriously hinder the progress of the project. The project will not be executed for a long time due to disputes between some members. In order to reduce or reduce this risk, a good leader is essential. First of all, we must select a leader that everyone recognizes and is responsible. When similar situations arise, the leader needs to think calmly, consult the opinions of each team member, and select a method that best meets the interests of the project to implement. This can effectively reduce the risk.</p>
