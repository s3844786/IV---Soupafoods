<h2>Project Risks:</h2>

<p>
In addition, there are differences in opinions among team members that are likely to cause project failure. Regarding a project, every detail requires a lot of discussion among members to arrive at a final plan and plan to implement it. But in the process of discussion, it is inevitable that there will be different opinions among members. Everyone thinks that their ideas are correct and want to persuade others to agree with their opinions. This kind of craftsmanship in order to develop good products is desirable, but to a certain extent, it will seriously hinder the progress of the project. The project will not be executed for a long time due to disputes between some members. In order to reduce or reduce this risk, a good leader is essential. First of all, we must select a leader that everyone recognizes and is responsible. When similar situations arise, the leader needs to think calmly, consult the opinions of each team member, and select a method that best meets the interests of the project to implement. This can effectively reduce the risk.
