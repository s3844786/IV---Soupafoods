<h2>Project Risks:</h2>
<p>In this project,one of the greatest risks is technical challenges which may lead to an incomplete project.
We have high expectations for this project so we added some features that are impossible  to achieve when we
actually build the prototype. For example one of the features is to  help users to find the expiration date
of items. And to achieve that users only need to scan the barcode of items. It may sound simple but to 
achieve this feature we need to acquire much more skillful and difficult knowledge about programming and 
databases. To tackle this risk, we need a lot of time to do the research and self-learning, and of course the 
frequency of group meetings needs to be increased,and if it's far beyond our ability we could try to show the
feature as completely as possible.
