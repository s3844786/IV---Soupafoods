    <p style="clear:right">I am a first year student in Bachelor of IT. I’m somewhat interested in IT and have found it to be the most enjoyable course that I’ve been studying. I hope to be able to develop websites as a starting point and then dive further into developing more technical software and programs. Communication is something that I find myself good at when it comes to group work. Currently I don’t have many strong points in the field of IT yet. Something that interests me is how technology continues to advance at a constant rate and hopefully someday I would like to be apart of that change. 
    </p>   

    <p style="clear:right"> My current weak points would definitely be the use of coding language to write code and develop webpages, programs etc. As an outcome of this project, I hope to learn more and develop a deeper understanding about HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to create web pages and programs. In terms of this project, I believe that I will have a bit of trouble with understanding GitHub as there is a lot of HTML and will probably ask for help from my team members.
    </p>

    <p>I see myself contributing to the team in the area of creating ideas and such for the application which we have chosen. In terms of technical IT skills I am not the best however I can see myself being able to provide ideas in discussions.
