<h2>Extended Features</h2>

<h6> ‘Money saved’ tracking as well as other statistics and achievements</h6>
<p>This feature will provide users a sense of achievement once they have successfully used the app. The purpose of this app is to help users save money on groceries, prevent, or reduce food wastage and to stay organised. When users see the statistics such as the amount of money they have saved or the amount of time they have saved by using the app, they will feel like they have accomplished something significant. This relates to every type of user ranging from university students to the elderly. We will make sure to successfully implement this feature as it is something that many applications have and seems to be a fun way of keeping users on track with their goal in mind.</p>

<h6> Synchronized shared experience</h6>
<p>In terms of use, this feature will probably be used within families. It helps to keep users connected with one another to keep track of what is in the pantry. This allows each member of the family to find out in real-time, what is purchased by each family member and the current inventory of the pantry. This feature will be added as an extended feature as it isn’t really a necessity however would be a nice implementation and useful for parents alongside students. The reasoning behind this feature is that the ability to link up with other users gives the application the ‘feel’ of a social media platform. Connectivity has been an increasingly important aspect to many new apps and we wish for our application to be successful in staying up-to-date with the latest trends.</p>

<h6> A Calendar feature</h6>
<p>This feature will be useful in things organised and timely which is a great way to stay efficient and save time. Staying organised is important to many of the targeted user profiles as it is a must for parents and students who are very limited on time. By implementing a calendar, it will give users easy access to see when a ‘favourite’ food is about to expire, when you last went to the shops, what days you have planned a meal for (meal prepping) etc. We have decided to add this as an extended feature in order to appeal to parents and students who wish to stay organised and thus stay efficient with their time.</p>
