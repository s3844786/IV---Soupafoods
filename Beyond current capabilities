<h2>Beyond current capabilities:</h2>
<p>
The knowledge I have now is not enough to support me to complete the entire project, so during this period,
I also want to make up for my shortcomings with the help of team members. One of the previous semesterâ€™s 
assignment is to build the prototype of an application,which provide me some centern skills on completing 
the assignment .For example,  I have now understood some knowledge about UCD, designing an app's prototype 
and user interface.In addition, I have some understanding of writing HTML code as well as JAVA.However, 
when it comes to web page designing, I find it's really struggle for me to write CSS code so I need to spend
more time to research about it and learn it by myself. As for this assignment, I need to learn some more 
complicated skills like how to track expiration dates of items by simply scanning their barcodes. And some 
database knowledge since we need to save users shopping history and synchronize each account to one another.
