<h2>Beyond current capabilities:</h2>

<p>
For now, this is my first year in university, and the knowledge I have can not complete the entire project. Therefore, I need some like-minded friends to form a team to face these difficulties together. I have studied the UI design of some applications before. I clearly know what kind of UI design can attract users, and it is simple and clear, so that users can quickly find the interface or function they need by browsing the interface information. In terms of software security, each user needs to have an independent account, otherwise their information can be easily stolen. I have learned some encryption algorithms, such as: RSA encryption, I think this will provide great help to the project. I may not have contacted some of the remaining content. I need to learn more professional knowledge and consult my teammates to make myself grow.
