<p>I am currently studying in China due to the covid-19. It’s my second semester as a IT student. My passion in IT started in high school when my teacher introduced me to a programming language called Visual Basic.In the last semester I have learned a new programming language--Java, which now I believe has become my strong point. My biggest weak point is communication,luckily in this course I now have many opportunities to communicate with my group and hopefully it will improve my communication skills. For the project, I am worried about user experiences. However, I believe that I can use the knowledge I learned from UCD class to help  my team to overcome this challenge.</p>
