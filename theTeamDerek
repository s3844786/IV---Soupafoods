<p>Hello, this is a picture of me to the right.I was born in Australia whereas both my parents come from China. 
I can understand and speak both Chinese and English</p>

<p>I have little knowledge in the IT field however I do hope to learn and understand more about the IT industry. 
I also hope that I am able to understand IT in finer detail as it is always evolving and taking it to the next 
level. My strong point is that if I need to complete something, I would try to complete it as soon as possible 
to the best of my ability. If I ever have extra time, I would be willing to assist my group members if they 
would need assistance to complete some tasks. In this period of time writing this, I currently have interests 
in UX and UI design as I find that area of IT interesting and amusing. I believe that that will have weak points 
such as a beginner at programming, or some other skills that I may have not have known that I am not strong in 
that area.</p>

<p>Some challenges that we may face with our project is to add as many features as possible without overwhelming 
or interfering with the users experience and usability. I believe that I can research much further into this 
project, what will make our project unique compared to others and help design the application for the 
prototype.</p>
