<h2>Minimal Viable Features:</h2>
<p>Shopping List:

In this feature, users can create a shopping list by themselves. The list contains some items we have already provided,
but users can add new items according to their own needs. Users can mark favorite items so they can easily find and add
these items to their shopping list. Not only that, users can also share their shopping list with their family or friends.
In addition, users only need to click on the calendar so they can add a shopping list on any day. When this day is 
almost there, users will receive a reminder that contains the information about  what they need to buy.
