    <h4>Short description</h4>
    <p>Trello is a team collaboration tool that can be used to manage individual or team task lists and it can help individual or team members to monitor work programs, what to do, etc.</p>
    <h4>Rational</h4>
    <p>Trello has a calendar and lists functions,which makes communication much more effective and efficient, so we have more time to do other things.

    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In our team which is known as Soupafoods, where our group members can all collaborate and contribute through several applications that enable sharing such as Google Drive where we are able to share our documents together which can be viewed and edited if needed. Our main source of communication is through Microsoft Teams where we are able to have our meetings with the addition of being able to send and receive messages to the team. We are also able to link our Trello board in Teams so we are able to identify what tasks need to be completed or what will be done in the near future. Lastly, we are able to combine our documents together which is turned into HTML code through GitHub, where we are able to share our code together which is then combined to create the completed assignment work.</p>
    <p>All of our group members communicate on Microsoft Teams where we are able to tell one another, such as a summary of a meeting that was missed, where we are all able to access the applications (Teams, Drive, GitHub and Trello) and contribute their share of work.</p>
